#Component tips
1. in vscode we must have jsx extention over our files to suggestion works
or instead we can use "import React from 'react';" in beggining of our files

2. if there are nothing between jsx tags it could be self closed
for example <Expanse> "There are nothing here"</Expanse> could be <Expanse />

3. in case of composition we cant regulary use components as wrapper around another components(for more information go to "040 The Concept of _Composition_ (_children props_)" course) 


#State tips
1. All events in jsx get function as input.
for example: onClick={() => {console.log("Clicked!")}}

2.function calls that used in jsx tags(like click event), must not have "()", for example, click function must call just "click" not "click()"
the reason is if we use click(), the fuction only call when its jsx tag read and not when click event triggered

3.useState function always return an array with exactly two element. The first element is current state of value and the second is the function for updating 
the first value
